This is a basic knowledge file for testing the RAG system.

Key Concepts:
1. The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches.
2. It uses embeddings to find relevant information from the knowledge base.
3. The system can process both text and PDF files.
4. Knowledge files should be placed in the agent/Knowledge directory.

Example Questions and Answers:
Q: What is RAG?
A: RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a system that combines retrieval of relevant information with text generation.

Q: How does the knowledge system work?
A: The system processes knowledge files, creates embeddings, and uses them to find relevant information when answering questions.

Q: Where should knowledge files be placed?
A: Knowledge files should be placed in the agent/Knowledge directory for the system to process them.

This is a test file to verify that the RAG system is working correctly. The system should be able to retrieve and use this information when answering questions.
